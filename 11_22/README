GDB Debug setup
==================
Debuging with Jlink+GDB is Recommended. You may follow the steps bellow:
1. Install the cross-compiler and Jlink driver on your local PC and setup the environment.
   Currently the version "gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major"  was perfect compatible with
   our Test Platform.
2. Open the "J-link GDB Server" and setup the basic configuration
3. Open a cmd window, and type in "arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe $(path)\imiTest_2280_ev1.axf",
   where $(path) should be the path which path you locate the "imiTest_2280_ev1.axf" file.
4. type in "tar remote :2331" for short or "target remote :2331" on the cmd window. And
   then, type in "load" command to load image.
5. Now, enjoy your GDB on the cmd window.
